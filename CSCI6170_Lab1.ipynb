Firstly, the dataset shows significant implicit missingness, primarily in the poutcome (81.7%) and contact (28.8%) features. High missingness in poutcome suggests that for the vast majority of the data, we have no historical interaction context to rely on for prediction. Second, the check returned 0 exact duplicates, indicating that every row in the dataset is unique. For target distribution, the dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, with the negative class (\"no\") making up 88.3% of the data and the positive class (\"yes\") only 11.7%. This means a baseline model that simply guesses \"no\" for every client would achieve over 88% accuracy.\n",
